# \<poly-prep\>

Helper elements to load polymer elements asynchronously.

There are lots of errors that get thrown when async flag is used for polymer references.  See [examples here](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/4631).  Apparently, some of these are caused by a bug in chrome.  Perhaps when that bug
is fixed, there will be no need for this component.



## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to serve your element locally.

## Viewing Your Element

```
$ polymer serve
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.
